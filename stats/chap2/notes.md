1. Example 2.23
![comb_problem_1](../images/combination_problem_1.png)
- the word "least" should suggest to you that you need to add up the probabilities.


2. Non intuitive at first but it makes sense

![comb_problem_2](../images/combination_problem_2.png)

You might ask why does the 2nd way of calculating this make sense. Why is it 95_c_5 on top?
- but why is it just 95C9/100C10? IF you think about it hard, it makes sense. if you add up all the ways you can do 95C9 for the last 9 beatles songs after the first 5 are chosen (and there’s only 1 way for this to happen) you should get the probability of the 5th song being a beatles song. It kind of makes sense. If you take into account all the ways 95C9 occurs, and there’s only 1 way for the last beatles song to be the 5th, and you divide it by the 100C10, you should get the probability that the last beatles song is 5th.
