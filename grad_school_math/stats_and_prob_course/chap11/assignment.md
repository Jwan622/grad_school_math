1. The data in the table on page 440 exercise 18 resulted from an experiment to investigate whether yield from a certain chemical process depended either on the formulation of a particular input or on mixer speed. A statistical computer package gave SS(form) = 2253.44, SS(Speed) = 230.81, SS(Form*Speed) = 18.58, and SSE = 71.87. Does yield appear to depend on either formulation or speed?
Group of answer choices

Both formulation and speed appear to have a highly statistically significant effect on yield.

Only formulation and not speed appear to have a highly statistically significant effect on yield.

Only speed and not formulation appear to have a highly statistically significant effect on yield.

Neither formulation nor speed appear to have a highly statistically significant effect on yield.




2. A study was carried out to compare the writing lifetimes of four premium brands of pens. It was thought that the writing surface might affect lifetime, so three different surfaces were randomly selected. A writing machine was used to ensure that conditions were otherwise homogeneous (e.g., constant pressure and a fixed angle). The table on page 441 exercise 22 shows the two lifetimes (min) obtained for each brand–surface combination. Carry out an appropriate analysis, and select all statements that are true.
Group of answer choices

Interaction between brand and writing surface has no significant effect on the lifetime of the pen.

Since neither f_A nor f_B is greater than its respective critical value, we can conclude that neither the surface nor the brand of pen has a significant effect on the writing lifetime.

8. Four different coatings are being considered for corrosion protection of metal pipe. The pipe will be buried in three different types of soil. To investigate whether the amount of corrosion depends either on the coating or on the type of soil, 12 pieces of pipe are selected. Each piece is coated with one of the four coatings and buried in one of the three types of soil for a fixed time, after which the amount of corrosion (depth of maximum pits, in .0001 in.) is determined. The data appears in the table on page 431 exercise #2. Compute {beta_hat}_1 - {beta_hat}_3 to 2 decimal places.


9. A particular county employs three assessors who are responsible for determining the value of residential property in the county. To see whether these assessors differ systematically in their assessments, 5 houses are selected, and each assessor is asked to determine the market value of each house. With factor A denoting assessors (I = 3) and factor B denoting houses (J = 5), suppose SSA = 11.7, SSB = 113.5, and SSE = 25.6. Explain why a randomized block experiment with only 5 houses was used rather than a one-way ANOVA experiment involving a total of 15 different houses, with each assessor asked to assess 5 different houses (a different group of 5 for each assessor).
Group of answer choices

Otherwise extraneous variation associated with houses would tend to interfere with our ability to assess assessor effects. If there really was a difference between assessors, house variation might have hidden such a difference. 

An observed difference between assessors might have been due just to variation among houses and the manner in which assessors were allocated to homes.

Otherwise extraneous variation associated with houses would tend to interfere with our ability to assess assessor effects. If there really was a difference between assessors, house variation is pretty good at revealing such a difference. 

None of the statements are true.
