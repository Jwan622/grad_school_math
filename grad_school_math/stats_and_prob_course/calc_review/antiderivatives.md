Certainly! Let's use the example of a rectangle to understand the concept of the antiderivative.

I think the takeaway here is that the derivative of the area function is the velocity... the rate at which the area is changing. That's why the antiderivative of a velocity function or any rate of change function is the area accumulated up to that point. That's why the integral of a velocity function between point a and point b is the antiderivative of that velocity function subtracted from point b with point a. This is an example below that helps with that intuition.

Suppose you have a rectangle with a constant height \( h \), and you're looking at how the area of the rectangle changes as you vary its width \( x \). Since the height is constant, the area \( A \) of the rectangle at any width \( x \) is simply the product of the height and width:


Below is an area formula. It's area = height * x (the horiz value). The derivative of area is just the height of the value of the curve.

\[ A(x) = h \cdot x \]

Here, \( A(x) \) is actually the antiderivative of the height \( h \), because if you take the derivative of \( A(x) \) with respect to \( x \), you get the height:

\[ \frac{dA}{dx} = h \]

Now, let's look at this graphically:

1. **Function \( f(x) = h \)**: This represents a constant function where for any value of \( x \), \( f(x) \) is equal to \( h \). If you were to plot this on a graph, it would be a straight horizontal line at the height \( h \).

2. **Antiderivative \( A(x) = h \cdot x \)**: This represents the area under the curve of \( f(x) \) from 0 to \( x \). As \( x \) increases, the rectangle's width increases, and so does the area linearly. If you were to plot this on a graph, it would be a line that starts at zero (when \( x = 0 \), the area is zero) and increases at a constant rate as \( x \) increases.

For example, if \( h = 3 \), the function \( f(x) = 3 \) represents a constant velocity of 3 meters per second. The antiderivative \( A(x) = 3x \) represents the displacement, which is the area under the velocity-time graph from 0 to \( x \). So, after 4 seconds, the displacement would be \( A(4) = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) meters.

In summary, in this rectangular example, the antiderivative \( A(x) \) represents the cumulative area of the rectangle as you increase its width from 0 to \( x \), and the derivative of this antiderivative gives you back the height of the rectangle, which is constant in this case.
