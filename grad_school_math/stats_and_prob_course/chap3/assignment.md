1. "Airlines sometimes overbook flights. Suppose that for a plane with 50 seats, 55 passengers have tickets. Define the random variable Y as the number of ticketed passengers who actually show up for the flight. The probability mass function of Y appears in the table on page 104 question 12. If you are the third person on the standby list (which means you will be the third one to get on the plane if there are any seats available after all ticketed passengers have been accommodated), what is this probability you will be able to take the flight? "

Work:
To calculate the probability that you, being the third person on the standby list, can take the flight, we need to consider the probability that at least 3 ticketed passengers do not show up. Since the plane has 50 seats and there are 55 ticketed passengers, we need to find the sum of the probabilities that at most 47 ticketed passengers show up (which corresponds to 8 or more passengers not showing up).

Using the probability mass function (pmf) given for Y (the number of ticketed passengers who show up), we calculate:
P(Y≤47) = P(Y=45) + P(Y=46) + P(Y=47) = 0.05 + 0.1 + 0.12 = 0.27

Work:
For you to be able to take the flight as the first person on the standby list, at least one ticketed passenger must not show up for the flight. In this case, we need to find the sum of the probabilities that at most 49 ticketed passengers show up.


P(Y≤49) = P(Y=45) + P(Y=46) + P(Y=47) + P(Y=48) + P(Y=49)

3. "Some parts of California are particularly earthquake-prone. Suppose that in one metropolitan area, 25% of all homeowners are insured against earthquake damage. Four homeowners are to be selected at random; let X denote the number among the four who have earthquake insurance. What is the most likely value for X? [Hint: Let S denote a homeowner who has insurance and F one who does not. Then one possible outcome is SFSS, with probability (.25)(.75)(.25)(.25) and associated X value 3. There are 15 other outcomes.]"

work:

We're looking at a binomial distribution scenario where:

The number of trials (n) is 4 (since four homeowners are selected),
The probability of success (p), which in this case is a homeowner having earthquake insurance, is 0.25,
The random variable X represents the number of successes, which in this case is the number of homeowners with insurance among the four selected.

For the first question about homeowners and earthquake insurance, we are looking for the mode of the binomial distribution with parameters n=4 (number of trials or homeowners) and 
p=0.25 (probability of success, which in this case is a homeowner having insurance).

use the probability mass function for the binomial distribution:

nCk * p^k ( 1- p )^(n-k) is the formula. turns out 1 has the highest probability. n = 4 and p = 0.25

highest is x = 1

answer:

4. "Three couples and two single individuals have been invited to an investment seminar and have agreed to attend. Suppose the probability that any particular couple or individual arrives late is .4 (a couple will travel together in the same vehicle, so either both people will be on time or else both will arrive late). Assume that different couples and individuals are on time or late independently of one another. Let X = the number of people who arrive late for the seminar. Obtain the cumulative distribution function of X, and use it to calculate P(2 <= X <= 6)."

work:

Given:
this is odd because if 1 person is late, then it's just 2c1 ways of 1 individual being late.
If it's 2 people being late, it's either 1 couple or 2 individuals being late.
the couples act as a unit. n sort of equals 5. 

P(0) meaning nobody is late is just 0.4^5
P(1) meaning 1 individual is late so it's 2c1 because there are 2 individuals. 2c1 * 0.4 * 0.6^(5-1) = 0.1037
P(2) means 2 individuals are late OR 1 couple is late. the two individuals being late is 2c2 * (0.4)^2 * (0.60)^3 + couple being late which is 3c1 * (0.40)^1 * (0.60)^(5-1) = 0.1901
P(3) means  1 individual AND 1 couple are late: 2c1 * (0.40)^1 * 3c1 * (0.40)^1 * (0.60) ^ 3 = 0.2074
P(4) means 2 individuals and 1 couple are late OR 2 couples are late: (0.4)^2 * 3c1 (0.40)^1 * (0.60)^2 + (3c2)(0.40)^2 * (0.60)^3 = 0.1728
P(5) = 0.1382
P(6) means 2 individuals and 2 couples are late OR 3 coupels are late: 0.0691

notice the difference between AND and OR and that determines whether we add or subract.

etc. You have to calculate the pmf up to 6 which then allows you to calculate the cdf becaus the answer is F(6) - F(1) which is 0.9591 - 0.1813 = 0.7778.

5. "The pmf of the amount of memory X (GB) in a purchased flash drive was given in the table found on page 113 exercise number 29. Compute V(X) using the shortcut formula"

work:
formula: V(X)=E(X^2) - (E(X))^2

we need to calculate E(x) first. we also need E(X^2)

x=1,2,4,8,16
p(x) = 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.35 , 0.40 , 0.10

for find E(X), take each value of x and multiply it by the probability and sum it all up. = (1*0.05) + (2*0.10) + (4*0.35) etc = 6.45GB

to find E(X^2) you do: (1^2 * 0.05) + (2^2 * 0.10) + (4^2 * 0.35) = 57.25

shortcut formula: 57.25 - (6.25)^2 = 57.25 - 41.60 = 15.6475


6. Same question as above but using variance formula

7. "An appliance dealer sells three different models of upright freezers having 13.5, 15.9, and 19.1 cubic feet of storage space, respectively. Let X = the amount of storage space purchased by the next customer to buy a freezer. Suppose that X has the pmf denoted on page 113 exercise number 32. What is the variance of the price 25X - 8.5 paid by the next customer?"

work: 
the point of this question is to relate variance to linear transformation of variance.

Note that the cubic feet of the freezer is input to the price function.

If X is a random variable and Y is a transformed variable such that Y = aX + b, then the expected value and variance of Y are given by:
E(Y) = aE(X) + b
V(Y) = a^2 * V(X)

Let's calculate the variance of the price 25X − 8.5, the expected value of X^2 , and the variance V(X). Note the a = 25

Here's the pmf from the table provided in the image:
X = 13.5 with P(X) = 2/10
X = 15.9 with P(X) = 5/10
X = 19.1 with P(X) = 3/10

And alos remmeber the variance of X with the shortcut formula is:

`V(X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2`

So let's calculate intermediate steps to get the shortcut variance:

E(X) = 13.5 * 0.2 + 15.9 * 0.5 + 19.1 * 0.3 = 2.7 + 7.95 + 5.75 = 16.38
E(X^2) = 13.5^2 * 0.2 + 15.9^2 * 0.5 + 19.1^2 * 0.3 = 36.45 + 126.405 + 109.443 = 272.298
Variance = 272.298 - (16.38)^2 = 3.994 via shortcut variacne formula.
The variance transformed by 25X - 8.5 is 25^2 * V(X) = 625 * 3.994 = 2496

[Hint: The sum of the first n positive integers is n(n+1)/2, whereas the sum of their squares is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.]"

Okay so for n=7, they give us that the sum of the first n positive integers is 7 * 8 / 2 = 28
So EV = 28/7 = 4

So the sum of squares is 7 * 8 * 15 / 6 = 140

So by variance shortcut formula: 140 - 16 = 124 = variance when n = 7

[Hint: The sum of the first n positive integers is n(n+1)/2, whereas the sum of their squares is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.]"



use shortcut formula for n = 7
sum of squares = 140 because 7 * 8 * 15 / 6 = 140
E(x^2) - E(X)^2 = 140 - 16 = 124

we use what we saw before but also lets add:
P(3) = 25c3 * (0.05)^3 * (0.95)^ 22 = 2300 * (0.05)^3 * (0.95)^ 22 = 0.0930
P(4) = 25c4 * (0.05)^4 * (0.95)^ 21 = 12650 * (0.05)^4 * (0.95)^ 21 = 0.0269


so 0.2773 + 0.3649 + 0.2305 + 0.0930 + 0.0269 = 0.9926
P(4) - P(0) = 0.9926 - 0.2773

![chap_3_assignments_binomial2.png](../images/chap_3_assignments_binomial2.png)


remember what a binomial distribution is:

A binomial distribution is a probability distribution that summarizes the likelihood that a value will take one of two independent states across a series of trials. It is defined by two parameters: n and p

n is the number of trials, where a trial is an event with two possible outcomes (often termed as "success" and "failure").
p is the probability of success on an individual trial.

Characteristics of a binomial distribution include:
- Fixed Number of Trials: The number of experiments or trials is fixed in advance. Each trial is independent of the others, meaning the outcome of one trial does not affect the outcome of another.
- Binary Outcomes: Each trial has only two possible outcomes, which can be categorized as success or failure.
- Constant Probability: The probability of success 
- p is the same for each trial.
- Independent Trials: The trials are independent, meaning the outcome of any one trial does not influence the outcome of another trial.

19. A very large batch of components has arrived at a distributor. The batch can be characterized as acceptable only if the proportion of defective components is at most .10. The distributor decides to randomly select 10 components and to accept the batch only if the number of defective components in the sample is at most 2. What is the probability that the batch will be accepted when the actual proportion of defectives is .20? Specify your answer to 4 significant digits.


work:
To find the probability that the batch will be accepted given that the actual proportion of defective components is 0.20, we can use the binomial distribution with the parameters  n=10 (number of trials or components tested) and  p=0.20 (probability of finding a defective component). The batch will be accepted if there are at most 2 defective components in the sample, which translates to calculating 

P(X <= 2) where X is the number of defective components in the sample.

here p = 0.20. the part about at most 0.10 seems irrelevant
P(X = 0) = 10C0 * 0.20^0 * 0.80^10
P(X = 1) = 10C1 * 0.20^1 * 0.80^9
P(X = 2) = 10C2 * 0.20^2 * 0.80^8

What is the probability that the batch will be accepted when the actual proportion of defectives is .25? Specify your answer to 4 significant digits.

same as 19 but with a different p

P(X = 0) = 10C0 * 0.25^0 * 0.75^10
P(X = 1) = 10C1 * 0.25^1 * 0.75^9
P(X = 2) = 10C2 * 0.25^2 * 0.75^8

summing it up:
0.75^10 + 10 * 0.25 * (0.75)^9 + 45 * 0.0625 * (0.75)^8 = 0.5256

work:

This is a hypergeometric distribution problem since the selection does not involve replacement. The probability of exactly 10 of the first 15 projects being from the second section can be calculated using the hypergeometric distribution formula:


N = 50 : total number of projects
M = 30 : the number of projects from the second section
n = 15 : number of projects considered
k = 10 : is the desired number of projects from the second section among the first 15 graded.

negative binomial model


but couldn't hte family have 2 boys, 2 girls,  and then the 5th child is a girl or boy giving the family 3 of the same gender? It doesn't have to be all in a row right?
ChatGPT
You're absolutely right, and my previous explanation overlooked this crucial aspect of the scenario. The family can indeed have a mix of boys and girls before reaching three of the same gender, and it does not have to be in a row. This makes it a classic case for the negative binomial distribution, where we're interested in the trials until the third child of the same gender is born, irrespective of the order.

Given this understanding,
P(X=3) does not strictly mean the first three children are of the same gender in sequence, but rather that the third child of the same gender could indeed come after a mix of genders in the first four children, with the fifth child solidifying the count of three of one gender.

Let's correct the scenario with this in mind:

The family could have a sequence like BBGGB (two boys, then two girls, and a boy to make three boys in total) or GGBBG (two girls, then two boys, and a girl to make three girls in total), among other combinations, before reaching the condition of having three of the same gender.
To accurately determine P(X=3), we should consider that X=3 in the context of this problem actually means the family stops with the birth of the third child of the same gender, which could indeed happen at the 5th child (or later, but not relevant to this specific inquiry of X=3).

For P(X=3) as interpreted here, the more accurate scenarios to consider would involve combinations leading to the 5th child ensuring three of one gender, taking into account all possible sequences leading up to this point. However, there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation:


In scenarios like the one you mentioned (e.g., BBGGB or GGBBG), the actual calculation for reaching exactly three of the same gender on the third, fourth, or fifth trial involves more detailed combinatorial probabilities not covered by the simplified P(X=3) as initially explained.

Given the mixture of genders possible before achieving three of the same, and recognizing this as a misunderstanding in the premise provided, the calculation would indeed be different and more complex, involving the sum of probabilities across various sequences that achieve the criterion, typically modeled by the negative binomial distribution for reaching a specified number of successes (three boys or three girls) across a series of independent trials with two outcomes (boy or girl).

To accurately calculate the probability of having three children of the same gender within a sequence of births, considering all possible sequences leading up to that outcome, would involve detailed enumeration of those sequences and their probabilities, aligning more closely with the negative binomial distribution's application in scenarios with mixed outcomes prior to reaching a specific number of "successes".
